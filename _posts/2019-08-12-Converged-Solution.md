I dont know if putting this on github is the right place but maybe for the time being it is. In grad school I came across a term called converged solution, it meant the point on convergence of analytical and computational methods which signified that the computational results could now be believed for accuracy as the model has reached convergence. The difference of results between the two models has reached such a small level that the two models have converged. 
I did not think that converged solutions as an idea could be abstracted and applied to social processes too. Like a person tries to do something new but gets it wrong the first time , he tries again and still fails but applies the lesson that he has learnt in the first trial , he tries a third time and half succeeds and after repeated attempts succeeds at the task. The adjustments made along the way between the first time and the Nth time are like the residuals and after repeated attempts the residuals diminish in magnitude. 

This idea could also be applied on groups of people who have been working on a group of tasks where there are a lot of exchanges amongst the members of the groups. Throw a new guy into this mix and observe that there is getting-used-to time that the new guy needs to adjust to the crowd. The only way the new member can reach a converged solution is if he can observe the nature of workings and the thinking behind things, test the boundaries and work to reduce the residuals. So when people talk of the book: Blink or of thinking fast with respect to work this is probably what they mean. 
Its usually said that becoming an expert requires 10000 hours of continous deliberate work, thats probably what some people think it takes to reach a converged solution with respect to work related expertise. This is a useful way of thinking about things especially when you want to focus on the positive side of things and leave the negetives as residuals of trials. Once you reach a converged solution its like you've got the tune of it.
