Today I had been to a Data Engineering meetup and one of the topics that was on for today was How do you make your senior execs agree to using Predictive Machine Learning models. The person giving the talk had suggested making a POC for the tech aspects and then preparing the Sell before meeting the boss. By preparing the sell he meant finding the business points that would get the exec excited about using this shiny new piece at work by putting a number on the Lost Oppurtunity Cost. 

Now I was confused , how do you put a number to something you dont know how much it costs! The presenter dodged it by saying it was an estimate. Later on I had realised that when in negotiation we are in the business of playing with psychology. Even if the game is based on hard facts you still have to work your Boss's psychology to get them to agree. 

A lot of people in the enterprise world are either a people manager or a Tech person. Its rare to see that combination in a single person. But my view is thats where growth is. Tech is not intrinsic , its a part of business. Apply tech to show value in the same way that people would bring lighting to the house. No one brought electicity cause that was the new shiny thing, they got lighting in as that solved a problem.  

Having a strategic vision and tiying that with the technical details is not an easy process.
