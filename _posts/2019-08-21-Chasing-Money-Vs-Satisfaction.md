Chasing Money vs chasing satisfaction. I am listening to the book called How will you measure your life by clayton christensen et al and the author makes the case that money is not all in life. That those who have chased money as the single agenda through career growth have failed at other points in life. Especially since they had everything needed for a perfect life education, access to employment, pedigree and still had areas of life which were far from perfect. Christensens argument is that those who try doing what they like and pursue that as thier goal, which he calls motivators, takes care of the hygene factor or money that they make. You try to find what you like, you do keep at it till you find it and then you diligently keep doing it and the rest follows. I dont know if I have the courage to take that up. I do know that money for the sake of it is not going to get you happiness in life.  Well happiness might not be the right word, call it satisfaction instead. Reaching a state of contentment with life is like getting an A in most dimensions of life, academic, professional, economic, health, emotional, psychological. Miss even one dimension and you feel lost. I ha written an article during my grad days called "aim to be less sad", its kinda like that. Grit, determination and perseverence goes a long way to develop niche and that hopefully fits somewhere in the big picture economy and that allows you to make money while doing what you find satisfaction.
