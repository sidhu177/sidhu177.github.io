title: "The idea of Seniority in Dev World"

I have often come across people saying that senior role is where you make money and to become a senior you need 5 years + experiance. I had been to a meetup where I met some  'senior' folks and asked them to comment on the linkage between years of experiance and seniority. One of them was like "well its not about years , its about your ability to add value. I call him a senior who can take on tasks , understand the business implications and lead the team to implement the right solution. I invest little energy on him and he gives out a lot to the team". Another was like "Well you have to love your field and that shows only through consistency of work. I would say 8 years before you could be considered a senior in your field." While the other devs were not open to put a number on seniority , by virtue of how they were describing the transition to a senior role its clear that it does take time and anywhere between 5 to 8 years. Here's the catch, tools evolve in this field pretty fast. I cant be doing the stuff that I am doing now five years on. Then how can one be a senior in the tool, and how can one demonstrate seniority in architectural roles ?
