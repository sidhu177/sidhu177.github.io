Easier said than done. Keeping ahead of the curve is not easy especially with enterprise tech changing so quick. A lot of times its not the effeciency of the Tech its also the other aspects of tech like sales, communication and messaging, being at the right place at the right time. Reading educational material to keep up with the things going on is not easy , neither is choosing to listen to Tech podcasts over entertainment podcasts or audiobooks. One of the choices to make is between the tool and the field where tool is the software or progrmaming language and Field is the abstraction of the business process like application development or DevOps or ETL development.
