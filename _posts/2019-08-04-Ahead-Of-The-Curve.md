Easier said than done. Keeping ahead of the curve is not easy especially with enterprise tech changing so quick. A lot of times its not the effeciency of the Tech its also the other aspects of tech like sales, communication and messaging, being at the right place at the right time. Reading educational material to keep up with the things going on is not easy , neither is choosing to listen to Tech podcasts over entertainment podcasts or audiobooks. One of the choices to make is between the tool and the field where tool is the software or progrmaming language and Field is the abstraction of the business process like application development or DevOps or ETL development.

Getting ahead of the curve is like getting a PhD , you have to first survey the litreture , get an understanding of the landscape , make a contribution that will make you unique. The challenge is to understand the trend and align with it. Some folks are so charishmatic that they remake trend by power of their innovation , like steve jobs did with iPhone. Most of the time its incremental and not so significant.
