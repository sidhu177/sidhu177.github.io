# ON AI

I had an exchange of words with a few folks from my dept today on the topic of AI. I have to say that AI's is very misunderstood. Its like a space potato that could be fit to anything. It went something like this. First dev says AI is coming to IT and infrastructure and it will be great, following that I contend that AI is different from IT and cannot be merged so easily. dev1 - "Ofcourse it can, I can use my phone to scale up a kubernetes cluster , isnt that AI" ; me - "Scaling up kubernetes is not AI its mannual intervention, speech to text engine that converts your voice to commands is the AI component here and that is not related to infrastructure"; Dev2 - "Well when I think about AI then it means automation to me. First ML came and then AI is used to automate processes"; me - "automation is not AI , you dont need prediction for automating computer processes. AI means using some formula that has been trained using data for a specific classification or regression problem" dev2 - "Well when most people think of AI it means automation for them, you can continue believing what you think is right"; me - "this is a fact! not belief"
its incredible how the media message has conveyed an incorrect meaning of AI. ML is a subfield of AI and AI as a field of research has been since 1960s but ML as a field has only grown since 1990s. While the dual trends of AI and automation might be rocking our current innovation space its certainly true that AI is a component in the broader scope of automation.
